# Project Proposal

# Seraphim

* This semester, I would like to build Seraphim, a web application designed to empower users by enabling them to express their creativity and showcase their interests, including music tastes, art, TV shows, movies, animatons, styles, subcultures, and personal experiences.

* Seraphim seeks to address the need for a supportive and secure online space where individuals, especially women and minority groups, can connect with others and customize their profiles to reflect their unique identities. The application solves the problem of online harassment and objectification by providing a platform where users can freely share their thoughts and experiences without fear of being belittled or targeted.

* In a digital age where online interactions can be filled with negativity, harassment, and offensiveness, Seraphim aims to create a positive community where everyone can confidently and authentically express themselves. By focusing on security, support, and users, Seraphim ensures that everyone will have a space where they feel valued and respected.

## ♡ For whom?

* The target audience for Seraphim is for creative people who want to showcase their uncensored selves online without having to deal with objectification, harrassment, negativity, or trolls. This includes women, men, and others of appropriate ages, creative individuals and hobbyists like artists, video creators, directors, fashion designers, singers, bakers, writers, etc., and community-seekers like those heavily involved in fandoms/fanbases.

## ♡ How?

* From an end-user's perspective, Seraphim will offer:

&ensp;- Profile Signup & Customization: Users will be able to sign up and have the ability to fully customize their profiles, showcasing their unique style, interests, and creative works. This includes sharing music tastes, artwork, movies, TV shows, animations, and personal experiences, while adding visual elements to reflect their identity.

&ensp;- Safe Community Interaction: A robust moderation system will be in place to ensure harassment, objectification, and trolling are prevented. Users will be able to report, block, or mute other users, certain content, or private messages. Additionally, Seraphim will attempt to deal with negative online presences before being reported by other users.

&ensp;- Creative Showcasing & Interaction: Users will be able to share their creative works and projects, whether it’s art, videos, fashion, writing, or any form of self-expression, by being able to post blogs to their page and reply to the blogs of others.

&ensp;- Direct Messaging & Groups: Community-driven users can create or join groups/groupchats based on fandoms, hobbies, or shared interests. Additionally, users will be able to message each other privately.


## ♡ Scope

* The scope of Seraphim is appropriately balanced for a team of 4 to 6 programmers to complete within one semester. While it incorporates several key features such as profile customization, creative showcasing, community interactions, and private messaging, each feature is manageable and can be divided into clear tasks for team members.

* The project is not overly ambitious, as it uses existing frameworks and tools for user authentication, profile creation, and content moderation, allowing the team to focus on developing the unique aspects of Seraphim, such as its creative-sharing features and robust moderation systems. At the same time, it is complex enough to provide a meaningful challenge in terms of ensuring a smooth user experience, integrating social interaction functionalities, and implementing advanced security features.
